## Trillion OpenFDA Data Visualization Platform

[![Build Status](https://18fci.ttsiglobal.com/buildStatus/icon?job=18f-openfda)](https://18fci.ttsiglobal.com/me/my-views/view/All/job/18f-openfda/)

Trillion Technology Solutions, Inc. [(Trillion)] (http://www.ttsiglobal.com) has implemented a prototype – “Trillion OpenFDA Data Visualization Platform” [(ODV Platform)] (http://18f.ttsiglobal.com) - in response to GSA 18F Agile BPA that leverages industry leading open source technology stacks and developed using Agile development methodology.
## Methodology Approach
Trillion has embraced Agile since 2006 and successfully implemented several turnkey and mission critical applications in commercial and government sectors.  We leveraged this experience to create a compact set of Agile sprints for development a solution for the challenge posed by GSA 18F BPA.  Our team comprised of members who were self-organizing and cross-functional and participated in flushing out user stories, design and development, unit and integration testing.  One of the conference rooms in our office was barricaded off from the rest of the company and was used exclusively by the [ODV Platform Agile team](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/DesignPoolEvidencetoQuestion%201.pdf) for [daily Scrums, discussions and collaborative team development.](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/WorkeringSessions.pdf)
Sprint 0 comprised of understanding and detailing the requirements presented in the RFQ and creating a few skeleton user stories that created a bare bone structure of the prototype including [wireframes](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/18FWireframes.pdf), AWS setup and GitHub among others.  Core development was during Sprint 1, Sprint 2 and Sprint 3, each lasting 5 days.  User stories with acceptance were created after discussion among the team and with the product owner.  Daily Scrum meetings provided everyone to come together formally to discuss work done the previous day and the plan for that day in addition to bringing up impediments if any.  The last day of each sprint included sprint retrospective and review followed by sprint planning for the next sprint.  A product backlog was created by the [product owner](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/DesignPoolEvindenceforQ7.PDF) from which user stories were chosen for each sprint which went into the sprint backlog.  An open source Agile Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool – [Tiaga](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/AgileArtifacts.pdf) – was used for capturing all Agile artifacts.  End of the sprint deployments were done on the Amazon instance and a demo was provided to the product owner with feedback taken that was loaded back into the product backlog.  The product owner [“resolved”](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/GSA18FPrototypeIssues.pdf) the user stories to show acceptance of the deliverables.
## Design and Development Approach
The ODV Platform leans on a human centered design to provide an intuitive web based graphical user interface for citizens to view data provided by the government for consumption by the general public.  The prototype was implemented using a technology stack that is pluggable and requires minimal changes to substitute technology libraries.  Several years of experience with DevOps in the government and commercial sectors and associated lessons learned was useful in quickly putting together the DevOps platform for the ODV Platform.  Trillion used several tools for DevOps including GitHub for code repository, [AWS](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/requirement-4-Paas-IaaS.png) for Linux instances, Jenkins for Continuous Integration, [Mocha for testing](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/tree/master/app/spec), Docker for deployment, WAVE for 508 testing, Istanbul for code coverage and Datadog for continuous monitoring, among others.
SSL certificates are used for providing secure access to the ODV Platform. We used Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) PaaS services to created Web DMZ Zone Architecture. The VPC DMZ allow only 443 through Apache to connect to ODV Platform.

Our [deployment architecture](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/Deployment.png) shows how the technology stack is laid out across the environments. 

##ODV Features and Usage 
ODV Platform allows users an interactive user interface that provides a top down drill down method to accessing recall information provided by the government. Hierarchical information access works as follows:
* It starts at the top level from the [home page](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/18fHomePage.png) which takes them to an interactive graphic of the map of United States.  Recall information is available for each category – Drugs, Devices and Food.
* The users can click on [each state](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/18fUSMap.png) of the map to obtain a bar graph of annual historical color coded recall information, for each of the categories per US state. 
* Clicking on each annual [bar](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/18fAnnualRecall.png) in the graph, per category, provides monthly recalls for each category
*	Clicking on each category per [month](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/18fMonthlyRecall.png) lists detailed recall records for that month, US state and chosen category
*	The detailed list has [smart search](https://github.com/trillion1-repos/18f/blob/master/doc/18fListRecall.png) per each column shown.  Typing in part or full phrases filters down the records list to match the search pattern.
